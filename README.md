Pig Dice

Rules of play:
1. Player 1 rolls dice repeatedly, adding up scores until they choose to "hold" or they roll a 1
2. If the player holds, their score is added to their total and player 2 takes their turn
3. If the player rolls a 1, they lose both their turn and their score for that turn
4. When either player accumulates 100 points the game is over and that player declared the winner
